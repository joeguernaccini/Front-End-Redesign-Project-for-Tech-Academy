# Front End Redesign Project for Tech Academy

## Introduction
For the final two weeks of my time at the Tech Academy I worked with several others on a project to redesign the front-end of the classroom API. Some of my tasks included creating a new nav bar, footer, buttons, etc. During the two-week sprint there were several CSS issues that cropped-up that were handled with collaboration and research. 

Below are the descriptions of the stories I worked on, as well code snippets.
